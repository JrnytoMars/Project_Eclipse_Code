# Project_Eclipse_Code
The codebase for the Project_Eclipse game.
The full development of the game will be administered through here, features and specfic files will be developed through branches before pushed here.
Things aren't fully organized yet, so don't worry too much about creating new branches for every file; they can all be put in mechanics.
